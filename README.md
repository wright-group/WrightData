# WrightData
Raw data from Wright group publications.

Since the contents of this repository are too large for github, WrightData is designed to download files programmatically when required. If you would prefer to access the entire repository including all data, you can find full backups on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzJTClorMBuwV1FxRzJ2MEFpQm8).

Since March 2016, all data taken by our homemade acquisition software [PyCMDS](https://github.com/wright-group/PyCMDS) has been automatically pushed to a public google drive folder: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5XBhboKMJCTeFhpc0FRNlZ6Wlk .
