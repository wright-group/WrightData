# Lineshapes in TrEE


In the paper, the axes are plotted in relative units. However, the polarizations themselves were made (and are stored) using actual units. These are:

| index | axis | center | full width | number of points |
|-------|------|--------|------------|------------------|
| 0     | w1   | 7000   | 3000       | 41               |
| 1     | w2   | 7000   | 3000       | 41               |
| 2     | d1   | 0      | 400        | 21               |
| 3     | d2   | 0      | 400        | 21               |

Pulses are kept at 50 fs FWHM in simulation.

Monochromator is simulated with a 120 wavenumber window.
