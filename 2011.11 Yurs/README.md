## 2D Frequency Progression


## On Diagonal 2D Delay

### Location:
\\on diagonal 2D delay

### Data description:
Data is stored as a series of tab-delimited D1 slices. Collected April 6th 2010.

### File description:
The data is stored in a series of extensionless files generated by homebrew data acquisition software originally developed by Kent Meyer. Each row in the file is a single acquisition. The column assignments are:

1. OPA1 color (wn)
2. OPA2 color (wn)
3. monochromator color (wn)
4. delay 1 position (ps)
5. delay 2 position (ps)
6. signal (V)
7. OPA1 pyro reading (V)
8. OPA2 pyro reading (V)
9. empty
10. empty


## Off Diagonal 2D delay
