## 2D Frequencies
2D frequency-frequency scans at 3 different delay values near zero delay. Presented in Figure 3.  

### Location:
\\2D frequencies

### Data description:
Each 2D frequency is stored in its own .dat file. Collected April 11th 2012.

### File description:
The data is stored in a series of .dat files generated by COLORS (COntrol for Lots Of Research in Spectroscopy). Dat files are tab-delimited text files. Each row is an acquisition corresponding to a given set of hardware positions (a pixel in the experimental space). The columns are as follows. Columns containing data presented in this experiment are indicated in bold. In the internal Wright group labeling scheme, this is COLORS dat version 0. Due to the hardware details, delay 1 positions as recorded are the inverse of the delay positions as presented in the paper.
